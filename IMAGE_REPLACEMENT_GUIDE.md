If you want to use your specific images, please save them as:
- public/images/ai-hands.jpg (for 'Built on a strong AI' section)
- public/images/data-analysis.jpg (for 'Ensure you truly understand your data' section)  
- public/images/business-growth.jpg (for 'Designed to foster growth and success' section)

Then update the ContentSections.astro component to use these local paths instead of the Unsplash URLs.
